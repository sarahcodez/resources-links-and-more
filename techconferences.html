		<ul>
			<li><span class="bold">LesbiansWhoTech</span> - <a href="http://lesbianswhotech.org/" target="_blank">http://lesbianswhotech.org/</a><br />

			<!--<li><span class="bold">TruceConf</span> - <a href="http://truceconf.com/" target="_blank">http://truceconf.com/</a><br />
			TRUCEConf is a two-day conference, taking place in September, 2014. The goal is to help the tech community heal, through learning from others outside our industry and having an open dialogue and on how we can be better humans to each other in the world of tech. TRUCE stands for trust, respect, unity, compassion, and equality, and we’ll be working together in an open and safe environment to shift our culture in this direction.
			<br /><br />The goal is that by the end of the conference,  people feel empowered, inspired, and hopeful. We want them to feel like ambassadors of kindness and change for the better. We want them to feel like they’ve been heard and respected, and that they’ve built relationships with other people who care about the community as much as they do. We want them to feel like the culture at the conference was based in trust, respect, unity, compassion, and equality, and hope they feel like they have real actions they can employ when they get back home that will make the community a better place to be.</li>-->
